# Optimize Release Builds

This document is a guide for how to setup your release process to optimize release builds for speed and binary size.

## Features

Most projects don't use all the features the `zng` crate provides, the default features and `"view_prebuilt"` are convenient
during development as you can just start implementing your app and just use whatever feature you need, but once you compile a
release build you might find that the final executable is oversized.

The `Cargo.toml` example below setups two features `"dev"` and `"release"`.  The `"dev"` feature is enabled by default
and just enables all the default `zng` features and selects the prebuilt view-process, the `"release"` only selects the features
that are actually used by the release app.

```toml
[dependencies]
zng = { version = "*", default-features = false }

[features]
default = ["dev"]

# features in debug builds
dev = ["zng/default", "zng/view_prebuilt"]

# features in release builds
release = [
    "zng-ipc", # to support running the view-process as a separate process
    "zng/view", # build the view-process to avoid embedding the prebuilt binary
    "zng/crash_handler", # use the crash handler to recover from fatal crashes
    "zng/window", # enable the windows service and `Window!` widget
    "zng/button", # enable the `Button!` widget
]
```

To run with debug features just use `cargo run`.

To build a release use the command `cargo build --release --no-default-features --features release`. 

Note that the [`zng-template`] already setups something like this, if your project was created using `cargo zng new` you can just call `cargo do build-r`.

Note that you may need some external dependencies to build the `"view"` feature. See [the instructions](https://github.com/zng-ui/zng?tab=readme-ov-file#requirements) on the main README for more details.

To quickly find what features your app is actually using you can temporary set `default = ["release"]` and `cargo run`, the rustc error messages
usually show missing features.

## LTO and Codegen Units

The compiler has some parallelism by default to speedup compilation, you can configure the release profile to compile as a single unit
and use more aggressive optimization to reduce size and speedup the release app.

```toml
[profile.release]
lto = "fat"
codegen-units = 1
```

The `Cargo.toml` fragment above shows an override to the `release` profile that does not split the build into separate code units and enables link time optimization. This configuration will give you the best performance possible in release builds with the stable compiler, at the cost of compilation time.

## Binary Size

To optimize specifically for binary size you enable features that replace generics with dynamic dispatch and use optimization level `"z"`.

The `Cargo.toml` fragment below show changes you can add to the previous examples to optimize for size.

```toml
[features]
release = [
    "zng/dyn_node", # avoids deep nesting generics
    "zng/dyn_closure", # avoids many monomorphised copies of generic functions
]

[profile.release]
opt-level = "z" # instruct the compiler to optimize for size
```

Note that the [`zng-template`] already setups something like this, you just need to fill in the release features on each crate and call `cargo do build-r -z`.

### Nightly

If your project safety constraints allows the nightly compiler and an unstable feature you can enable `-Zshare-generics` to reduce size even more:

**Windows**
```prompt
set RUSTFLAGS=-Zshare-generics -C link-args=-znostart-stop-gc
cargo +nightly build --release
```

**Unix**
```prompt
RUSTFLAGS="-Zshare-generics -C link-args=-znostart-stop-gc" cargo +nightly build --release
```

In the command line example above the `RUSTFLAGS` is set to enable the `share-generics` feature that reduces many monomorphised copies of generic functions and the `cargo +nightly` compiler is used because share-generics is unstable.

The example also sets the `-C link-args=-znostart-stop-gc`, this is to workaround a nightly only linker issue that affects a dependency of `zng`. Note
that every nightly release can cause all kinds of issues and the `zng` project is only officially supported on the latest stable Rust release. This
optimization was tested on the `2025-01-08` nightly release.

The [`zng-template`] already setups something like this, call `cargo do build -r -z --bleed` to compile with nightly optimizations.
