# Contributing to Zng

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Zng! There are many ways to contribute
and we appreciate all of them.

### Review Our English

None of the core developers are native speakers, if you see any grammar mistake, typo 
or sentence that doesn't read right don't hesitate to create a pull request.

### Report a Bug

Create an issue, provide a minimal reproducible example (MRE) that triggers the issue, 
if manual interaction needs to happen, provide a list of steps to follow to cause the issue. 

The issue must happen in the latest release or newer (master branch) and after running `cargo update`.

### Close a Todo

The project is under active development, the [todo] issue label tracks things that need to 
be implemented. To claim a todo open a draft pull request that references the issue or leave a comment.

If you need help getting started leave a comment under the todo issue or start a [new discussion].

## Project Overview

The [`examples`] README provides a list of examples with screenshots and instruction on how to contribute an example.

The [`tools`] README provides an overview of the tools used to manage the project, in 
particular the `cargo do` tool that must be used for testing.

### VSCode & Rust Analyzer

Some workspace settings are included in the repository, in particular, `rust-analyzer` "checkOnSave" 
and runnables are redirected to the `do` tool, and format is redirected to `cargo-zng fmt --stdin`.
