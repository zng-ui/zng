   = note: this error originates in the macro `zng::__proc_macro_util::widget::widget_new` which comes from the expansion of the macro `Wgt` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
help: there is a method `allowed_in_when_assign` with a similar name
  --> $WORKSPACE/crates/zng-wgt/src/wgt.rs
