  = help: items from traits can only be used if the trait is implemented and in scope
  = note: the following trait defines an item `widget_intrinsic`, perhaps you need to implement it:
          candidate #1: `WidgetImpl`
  = note: this error originates in the attribute macro `widget` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
help: trait `WidgetImpl` which provides `widget_intrinsic` is implemented but not in scope; perhaps you want to import it
