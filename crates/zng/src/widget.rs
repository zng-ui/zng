/// Expands a struct to a widget struct and macro.

/// Each widget is a struct and macro pair of the same name that builds a custom widget using [`WidgetBuilder`]. Widgets
/// *inherit* from one other widget and can also inherit multiple mixins. Widgets can have intrinsic nodes, default properties
/// and can build to a custom output type.
///
/// Properties can be strongly associated with the widget using the `#[property(.., widget_impl(Widget))]` directive, existing properties
/// can be implemented for the widget using the [`widget_impl!`] macro.
///
/// # Attribute
///
/// The widget attribute must be placed in a `struct Name(Parent);` declaration, only struct following the exact pattern are allowed,
/// different struct syntaxes will generate a compile error.
///
/// The attribute requires one argument, it must be a macro style `$crate` path to the widget struct, this is used in the generated macro
/// to find the struct during instantiation. The path must be to the *public* path to the struct, that is, the same path that will be used
/// to import the widget. After the required widget path [custom rules](#custom-rules) for the generated macro can be declared.
///
/// ```
/// # fn main() { }
/// use zng::prelude_wgt::*;
///
/// /// Minimal widget.
/// #[widget($crate::Foo)]
/// pub struct Foo(WidgetBase);
/// ```
///
/// # Inherit
///
/// The widget struct field must be the parent widget type. All widgets inherit from another or the
/// [`WidgetBase`], the parent widgets intrinsic properties and nodes are all included in the new widget. The intrinsic
/// properties are included by deref, the new widget will dereference to the parent widget, during widget build auto-deref will select
/// the property methods first, this mechanism even allows for property overrides.
///
/// # Intrinsic
///
/// The widget struct can define a method `widget_intrinsic` that includes custom build actions in the [`WidgetBuilder`], this special
/// method will be called once for the widget. The same method is also called for the inherited widgets.
///
/// ```
/// # fn main() { }
/// use zng::prelude_wgt::*;
///
/// #[widget($crate::Foo)]
/// pub struct Foo(WidgetBase);
///
/// impl Foo {
///     fn widget_intrinsic(&mut self) {
///         self.widget_builder().push_build_action(|b| {
///             // push_intrinsic, capture_var.
///         });
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The example above demonstrates the intrinsic method used to [`push_build_action`]. This is the primary mechanism for widgets to define their
/// own behavior that does not depend on properties. Note that the widget inherits from [`WidgetBase`], during instantiation
/// of `Foo!` the base `widget_intrinsic` is called first, then the `Foo!` `widget_intrinsic` is called.
///
/// The method does not need to be `pub`, and it is not required.
///
/// # Build
///
/// The widget struct can define a method that builds the final widget instance.
///
/// ```
/// # fn main() { }
/// use zng::prelude_wgt::*;
///
/// #[widget($crate::Foo)]
/// pub struct Foo(WidgetBase);
///
/// impl Foo {
///     /// Custom build.
///     pub fn widget_build(&mut self) -> UiNode {
///         println!("on build!");
///         WidgetBase::widget_build(self)
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The build method must have the same visibility as the widget, and can define its own
/// return type, this is the widget instance type. If the build method is not defined the inherited parent build method is used.
///
/// Unlike the [intrinsic](#intrinsic) method, the widget only has one `widget_build`, if defined it overrides the parent
/// `widget_build`. Most widgets don't define their own build, leaving it to be inherited from [`WidgetBase`]. The base instance type
/// is an opaque `UiNode`.
///
/// Normal widgets instance types must implement [`IntoUiNode`], otherwise they cannot be used as child of other widgets.
/// The widget outer-node also must implement the widget context, to ensure that the widget is correctly placed in the UI tree.
/// Note that you can still use the parent type build implementation, so even if you need
/// to run code on build or define a custom type you don't need to deref to the parent type to build.
///
/// # Defaults
///
/// The [`widget_set!`] macro can be used inside `widget_intrinsic` to set properties and when conditions that are applied on the widget by default,
/// if not overridden by derived widgets or the widget instance. During the call to `widget_intrinsic` the `self.importance()` value is
/// [`Importance::WIDGET`], after it is changed to [`Importance::INSTANCE`], so just by setting properties in `widget_intrinsic` they
/// will have less importance allowing for the override mechanism to replace them.
///
/// # Impl Properties
///
/// The [`widget_impl!`] macro can be used inside a `impl WgtIdent { }` block to strongly associate a property with the widget,
/// and the [`property`] attribute has a `widget_impl(WgtIdent)` directive that also strongly associates a property with the widget.
///
/// These two mechanisms can be used to define properties for the widget, the impl properties don't need to be imported and are
/// always selected over other properties of the same name. They also appear in the widget documentation and can have a distinct
/// visual in IDEs as they are represented by immutable methods while standalone properties are represented by mutable trait methods.
///
/// As a general rule only properties that are captured by the widget, or only work with the widget, or have an special meaning in the widget
/// are implemented like this, standalone properties that can be used in any widget are not implemented.
///
/// # Generated Macro
///
/// The generated widget macro has the same syntax as [`widget_set!`], except that is also starts the widget and builds it at the end.
///
/// This widget macro call:
///
/// ```
/// # use zng::prelude_wgt::*;
/// # #[widget($crate::Foo)]
/// # pub struct Foo(WidgetBase);
/// #
/// # fn main() {
/// let wgt = Foo! {
///     id = "foo";
/// };
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// Expands to this:
///
/// ```
/// # use zng::prelude_wgt::*;
/// # #[widget($crate::Foo)]
/// # pub struct Foo(WidgetBase);
/// #
/// # fn main() {
/// let wgt = {
///     let mut wgt = Foo::widget_new();
///     widget_set! {
///         &mut wgt;
///         id = "foo";
///     }
///     wgt.widget_build()
/// };
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// #### Custom Rules
///
/// You can declare custom rules for the widget macro, this can be used to declare custom shorthand syntax for the widget.
///
/// The custom rules are declared inside braces after the widget path in the widget attribute. The syntax is similar to `macro_rules!`
/// rules, but the expanded tokens are the direct input of the normal widget expansion.
///
/// ```txt
/// (<rule>) => { <init> };
/// ```
///
/// The `<rule>` is any macro pattern rule, the `<init>` is the normal widget init code that the rule expands to.
///
/// Note that custom rules are not inherited, they apply only to the declaring widget macro, inherited widgets must replicate
/// the rules if desired.
///
/// Example of a widget that declares a shorthand syntax to implicitly set the `id` property:
///
/// ```
/// use zng::prelude_wgt::*;
///
/// #[widget($crate::Foo { ($id:expr) => { id = $id; }; })]
/// pub struct Foo(WidgetBase);
///
/// # fn main() {
/// let wgt = Foo!("foo");
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// The macro instance above is equivalent to:
///
/// ```
/// # use zng::prelude_wgt::*;
/// # #[widget($crate::Foo)]
/// # pub struct Foo(WidgetBase);
/// #
/// # fn main() {
/// let wgt = Foo! {
///     id = "foo";
/// };
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// #### Limitations
///
/// The expanded tokens can only be a recursive input for the same widget macro, you can't expand to a different widget.
///
/// Some rules are intercepted by the default widget rules:
///
/// * `$(#[$attr:meta])* $($property:ident)::+ = $($rest:tt)*`, blocks all custom `$ident = $tt*` patterns.
/// * `$(#[$attr:meta])* when $($rest:tt)*`, blocks all custom `when $tt*` patterns.
///
/// Note that the default single property shorthand syntax is not blocked, for example `Text!(font_size)` will match
/// the custom shorthand rule and try to set the `txt` with the `font_size` variable, without the shorthand it would create a widget without
/// `txt` that sets `font_size`. So a custom rule `$p:expr` is only recommended for widgets that have a property of central importance.
///
/// # Widget Type
///
/// A public associated function `widget_type` is also generated for the widget, it returns a [`WidgetType`] instance that describes the
/// widget type. Note that this is not the widget instance type, only the struct and macro type. If compiled with the `"inspector"` feature
/// the type is also available in the widget info.

pub use zng_app::widget::easing;

/// Expands a function to a widget property.
///
/// Property functions take one [`IntoUiNode`] child input and one or more other inputs and produces an [`UiNode`] that implements
/// the property feature. Alternatively it takes one [`WidgetBuilding`] input plus other inputs and modifies the widget build.
///
/// The attribute expansion does not modify the function, it can still be used as a function directly. Some
/// properties are implemented by calling other property functions to generate a derived effect.
///
/// The attribute expansion generates a hidden trait of the same name and visibility, the trait is implemented for widget builders,
/// the widget macros use this to set the property. Because it has the same name it is imported together with the property
/// function, in practice this only matters in doc links where you must use the `fn@` disambiguator.
///
/// # Attribute Args
///
/// The property attribute has one required argument and three optional.
///
/// #### Nest Group
///
/// The first argument is the property [`NestGroup`]. The group defines the overall nest position
/// of the property, for example, `LAYOUT` properties always wrap `FILL` properties. This is important as widgets are open and any combination
/// of properties may end-up instantiated in the same widget.
///
/// ```
/// # fn main() { }
/// use zng::prelude_wgt::*;
///
/// #[property(LAYOUT)]
/// pub fn align(child: impl IntoUiNode, align: impl IntoVar<Align>) -> UiNode {
///     // ..
///     # child.into_node()
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The nest group can be tweaked, by adding or subtracting integers, in the example bellow both properties are in the `SIZE` group,
/// but `size` is always inside `max_size`.
///
/// ```
/// # fn main() { }
/// use zng::prelude_wgt::*;
///
/// #[property(SIZE+1)]
/// pub fn size(child: impl IntoUiNode, size: impl IntoVar<Size>) -> UiNode {
///     // ..
///     # child.into_node()
/// }
///
/// #[property(SIZE)]
/// pub fn max_size(child: impl IntoUiNode, size: impl IntoVar<Size>) -> UiNode {
///     // ..
///     # child.into_node()
/// }
/// ```
///
/// #### Default
///
/// The next argument is an optional `default(args..)`. It defines the value to use when the property must be instantiated and no value was provided.
/// The defaults should cause the property to behave as if it is not set, as the default value will be used in widgets that only set the
/// property in `when` blocks.
///
/// ```
/// # fn main() { }
/// use zng::prelude_wgt::*;
///
/// #[property(FILL, default(rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)))]
/// pub fn background_color(child: impl IntoUiNode, color: impl IntoVar<Rgba>) -> UiNode {
///     // ..
///     # child.into_node()
/// }
/// ```
///
/// In the example above the `background_color` defines a transparent color as the default, so if the background color is only set in a `when`
/// block if will only be visible when it is active.
///
/// For properties with multiple inputs the default args may be defined in a comma separated list of params, `default(dft0, ..)`.
///
/// #### Impl For
///
/// The last argument is an optional `impl(<widget-type>)`, it strongly associates
/// the property with a widget, users can set this property on the widget without needing to import the property.
///
/// Note that this makes the property have priority over all others of the same name, only a derived widget can override
/// with another strongly associated property.
///
/// Note that you can also use the [`widget_impl!`] in widget declarations to implement existing properties for a widget.
///
/// # Function Args
///
/// The property function requires at least two args, the first is the child node and the other(s) the input values. The
/// number and type of inputs is validated at compile time, the types are limited and are identified and validated by their
/// token name, so you cannot use renamed types.
///
/// #### Child
///
/// The first function arg must be of type `impl IntoUiNode`, it represents the child node and the property node must
/// delegate to it so that the UI tree functions correctly. The type must be an `impl` generic, a full path to [`IntoUiNode`]
/// is allowed, but no import renames as the proc-macro attribute can only use tokens to identify the type.
///
/// ##### Or Building
///
/// Alternatively, the first function arg must be of type `&mut WidgetBuilding`, in this case the property function runs
/// during widget build and can do things like insert multiple nodes on the widget or set the widget child node.
///
/// #### Inputs
///
/// The second arg and optional other args define the property inputs. When a property is assigned in a widget only these inputs
/// are defined by the user, the child arg is provided by the widget builder. Property inputs are limited, and must be identifiable
/// by their token name alone. The types are validated at compile time, they must be declared using `impl` generics,
/// a full path to the generic traits is allowed, but no import renames.
///
/// #### Input Types
///
/// These are the allowed input types:
///
/// ##### `impl IntoVar<T>`
///
/// The most common type, accepts any value that can be converted [`IntoVar<T>`], usually the property defines the `T`, but it can be generic.
/// The property node must respond to var updates. The input kind is [`InputKind::Var`]. No auto-default is generated for this type, property
/// implementation should provide a default value that causes the property to behave as if it was not set.
///
/// The input can be read in `when` expressions and can be assigned in `when` blocks.
///
/// ##### `impl IntoValue<T>`
///
/// Accepts any value that can be converted [`IntoValue<T>`] that does not change, usually the property
/// defines the `T`, but it can be generic. The input kind is [`InputKind::Value`]. No auto-default is generated for this type.
///
/// The input can be read in `when` expressions, but cannot be assigned in `when` blocks.
///
/// ##### `impl IntoUiNode`
///
/// This input accepts another [`UiNode`], the implementation must handle it like it handles the child node, delegating all methods. The
/// input kind is [`InputKind::UiNode`]. The [`UiNode::nil`] is used as the default value if no other is provided.
///
/// The input cannot be read in `when` expressions, but can be assigned in `when` blocks.
///
/// Note that UI lists like [`ui_vec!`] are also nodes, so panel children properties also receive `impl IntoUiNode`.
///
/// ##### `Handler<A>`
///
/// This input is the type alias [`Handler<A>`], generic for the argument type `A`, usually the property defines the `A`, but it can be generic.
/// The input kind is [`InputKind::Handler`]. A no-op handler is used for the default if no other is provided.
///
/// Event handler properties usually have the `on_` name prefix. You can use the [`event_property!`] macro to generate standard event properties.
///
/// The input cannot be read in `when` expressions, but can be assigned in `when` blocks.
///
/// # Getter Properties
///
/// Most properties with var inputs are *setters*, that is the inputs affect the widget. Some properties
/// can be *getters*, detecting widget state and setting it on the *input* variable. These properties are usually named with
/// a prefix that indicates their input is actually for getting state, the prefixes `is_` and `has_` mark a property with
/// a single `bool` input that reads a widget state, the prefix `get_` and `actual_` marks a property that reads a non-boolean state from
/// the widget.
///
/// Getter properties are configured with a default read-write variable, so that they can be used in `when` expressions directly,
/// for example, `when *#is_pressed`, the `is_pressed` property has a `default(var(false))`, so it automatically initializes
/// with a read-write variable that is used in the when condition. The property attribute generates defaults automatically
/// based on the prefix, the default is `var(T::default())`, this can be overwritten just by setting the default,
/// it is not possible to declare a getter property without default.
///
/// Note that if a property is used in `when` condition without being set and without default value the when block is discarded on
/// widget build. If you are implementing a getter property that is not named using the prefixes listed above you must set `default(var(T::default())`.
///
/// # Generics
///
/// Apart from the `impl` generics of inputs and child, there is some support for named generic types, only one named generic is allowed
/// for inputs `impl IntoVar<T>`, `impl IntoValue<T>` and `Handler<A>`.
///
/// # Output
///
/// The property output type must be [`UiNode`]. The property node implementation can be anything, as long as it delegates
/// to the child node, see [`match_node`] or [`ui_node`] about implementing a node.
///
/// Some common property patterns have helper functions, for example, to setup a context var you can use the [`with_context_var`] function.
///
/// # Build Action Properties
///
/// Property functions can take a `&mut WidgetBuilding` first arg, in this case they are *build action properties*. These properties cannot
/// be instantiated into a node, they only work if set on an widget. The property function is called during widget build, after property resolution
/// and widget intrinsic build actions, the function can modify the [`WidgetBuilding`], just like an intrinsic build action.
///
/// ```
/// # fn main() { }
/// use zng::prelude_wgt::*;
///
/// #[property(CHILD)]
/// pub fn child(wgt: &mut WidgetBuilding, child: impl IntoUiNode) {
///     wgt.set_child(child);
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The example above declares a simple property that replaces the widget child.
///
/// ## Capture Only
///
/// Some widgets intrinsic behavior depend on the value of multiple properties that cannot provide any implementation by themselves. In
/// this case the property should be declared as a build action property and call [`expect_property_capture`].
/// The widget them must capture the property during build, if it does not an error is logged in build with debug assertions enabled.
///
/// ```
/// # fn main() { }
/// use zng::prelude_wgt::*;
/// # #[widget($crate::MyPanel)]
/// # pub struct MyPanel(WidgetBase);
///
/// #[property(CHILD, widget_impl(MyPanel))]
/// pub fn children(wgt: &mut WidgetBuilding, children: impl IntoUiNode) {
///     let _ = children;
///     wgt.expect_property_capture();
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The example above declares a property that expects to be captured, if the property function actually runs it will log an error
/// in builds with debug assertions enabled.
///
