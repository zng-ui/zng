/// Expands a struct to a widget struct and macro.

/// *inherit* from one other widget and can also inherit multiple mix-ins. Widgets can have intrinsic nodes, default properties
/// and can build to a custom output type.
///
/// Properties can be strongly associated with the widget using the `#[property(.., widget_impl(Widget))]` directive, existing properties
/// can be implemented for the widget using the [`widget_impl!`] macro.
///
/// # Attribute
///
/// The widget attribute must be placed in a `struct Name(Parent);` declaration, only struct following the exact pattern are allowed,
/// different struct syntaxes will generate a compile error.
///
/// The attribute requires one argument, it must be a macro style `$crate` path to the widget struct, this is used in the generated macro
/// to find the struct during instantiation. The path must be to the *public* path to the struct, that is, the same path that will be used
/// to import the widget. After the required widget path [custom rules](#custom-rules) for the generated macro can be declared.
///
/// ```
/// # fn main() { }
/// use zng::prelude_wgt::*;
///
/// /// Minimal widget.
/// #[widget($crate::Foo)]
/// pub struct Foo(WidgetBase);
/// ```
///
/// # Inherit
///
/// The widget struct field must be the parent widget type. All widgets inherit from another or the
/// [`WidgetBase`], the parent widgets intrinsic properties and nodes are all included in the new widget. The intrinsic
/// properties are included by deref, the new widget will dereference to the parent widget, during widget build auto-deref will select
/// the property methods first, this mechanism even allows for property overrides.
///
/// # Intrinsic
///
/// The widget struct can define a method `widget_intrinsic` that includes custom build actions in the [`WidgetBuilder`], this special
/// method will be called once for the widget. The same method is also called for the inherited widgets.
///
/// ```
/// # fn main() { }
/// use zng::prelude_wgt::*;
///
/// #[widget($crate::Foo)]
/// pub struct Foo(WidgetBase);
///
/// impl Foo {
///     fn widget_intrinsic(&mut self) {
///         self.widget_builder().push_build_action(|b| {
///             // push_intrinsic, capture_var.
///         });
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The example above demonstrates the intrinsic method used to [`push_build_action`]. This is the primary mechanism for widgets to define their
/// own behavior that does not depend on properties. Note that the widget inherits from [`WidgetBase`], during instantiation
/// of `Foo!` the base `widget_intrinsic` is called first, then the `Foo!` `widget_intrinsic` is called.
///
/// The method does not need to be `pub`, and it is not required.
///
/// # Build
///
/// The widget struct can define a method that builds the final widget instance.
///
/// ```
/// # fn main() { }
/// use zng::prelude_wgt::*;
///
/// #[widget($crate::Foo)]
/// pub struct Foo(WidgetBase);
///
/// impl Foo {
///     /// Custom build.
///     pub fn widget_build(&mut self) -> impl UiNode + use<> {
///         println!("on build!");
///         WidgetBase::widget_build(self)
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The build method must have the same visibility as the widget, and can define its own
/// return type, this is the widget instance type. If the build method is not defined the inherited parent build method is used.
///
/// Unlike the [intrinsic](#intrinsic) method, the widget only has one `widget_build`, if defined it overrides the parent
/// `widget_build`. Most widgets don't define their own build, leaving it to be inherited from [`WidgetBase`]. The base instance type
/// is an opaque `impl UiNode`.
///
/// Normal widgets must implement [`UiNode`], otherwise they cannot be used as child of other widgets.
/// The widget outer-node also must implement the widget context, to ensure that the widget is correctly placed in the UI tree.
/// Note that you can still use the parent type build implementation, so even if you need
/// to run code on build or define a custom type you don't need to deref to the parent type to build.
///
/// # Defaults
///
/// The [`widget_set!`] macro can be used inside `widget_intrinsic` to set properties and when conditions that are applied on the widget by default,
/// if not overridden by derived widgets or the widget instance. During the call to `widget_intrinsic` the `self.importance()` value is
/// [`Importance::WIDGET`], after it is changed to [`Importance::INSTANCE`], so just by setting properties in `widget_intrinsic` they
/// will have less importance allowing for the override mechanism to replace them.
///
/// # Impl Properties
///
/// The [`widget_impl!`] macro can be used inside a `impl WgtIdent { }` block to strongly associate a property with the widget,
/// and the [`property`] attribute has a `widget_impl(WgtIdent)` directive that also strongly associates a property with the widget.
///
/// These two mechanisms can be used to define properties for the widget, the impl properties don't need to be imported and are
/// always selected over other properties of the same name. They also appear in the widget documentation and can have a distinct
/// visual in IDEs as they are represented by immutable methods while standalone properties are represented by mutable trait methods.
///
/// As a general rule only properties that are captured by the widget, or only work with the widget, or have an special meaning in the widget
/// are implemented like this, standalone properties that can be used in any widget are not implemented.
///
/// # Generated Macro
///
/// The generated widget macro has the same syntax as [`widget_set!`], except that is also starts the widget and builds it at the end.
///
/// This widget macro call:
///
/// ```
/// # use zng::prelude_wgt::*;
/// # #[widget($crate::Foo)]
/// # pub struct Foo(WidgetBase);
/// #
/// # fn main() {
/// let wgt = Foo! {
///     id = "foo";
/// };
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// Expands to this:
///
/// ```
/// # use zng::prelude_wgt::*;
/// # #[widget($crate::Foo)]
/// # pub struct Foo(WidgetBase);
/// #
/// # fn main() {
/// let wgt = {
///     let mut wgt = Foo::widget_new();
///     widget_set! {
///         &mut wgt;
///         id = "foo";
///     }
///     wgt.widget_build()
/// };
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// #### Custom Rules
///
/// You can declare custom rules for the widget macro, this can be used to declare custom shorthand syntax for the widget.
///
/// The custom rules are declared inside braces after the widget path in the widget attribute. The syntax is similar to `macro_rules!`
/// rules, but the expanded tokens are the direct input of the normal widget expansion.
///
/// ```txt
/// (<rule>) => { <init> };
/// ```
///
/// The `<rule>` is any macro pattern rule, the `<init>` is the normal widget init code that the rule expands to.
///
/// Note that custom rules are not inherited, they apply only to the declaring widget macro, inherited widgets must replicate
/// the rules if desired.
///
/// Example of a widget that declares a shorthand syntax to implicitly set the `id` property:
///
/// ```
/// use zng::prelude_wgt::*;
///
/// #[widget($crate::Foo {
///     ($id:expr) => {
///         id = $id;
///     };
/// })]
/// pub struct Foo(WidgetBase);
///
/// # fn main() {
/// let wgt = Foo!("foo");
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// The macro instance above is equivalent to:
///
/// ```
/// # use zng::prelude_wgt::*;
/// # #[widget($crate::Foo)]
/// # pub struct Foo(WidgetBase);
/// #
/// # fn main() {
/// let wgt = Foo! {
///     id = "foo";
/// };
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// #### Limitations
///
/// The expanded tokens can only be a recursive input for the same widget macro, you can't expand to a different widget.
///
/// Some rules are intercepted by the default widget rules:
///
/// * `$(#[$attr:meta])* $($property:ident)::+ = $($rest:tt)*`, blocks all custom `$ident = $tt*` patterns.
/// * `$(#[$attr:meta])* when $($rest:tt)*`, blocks all custom `when $tt*` patterns.
///
/// Note that the default single property shorthand syntax is not blocked, for example `Text!(font_size)` will match
/// the custom shorthand rule and try to set the `txt` with the `font_size` variable, without the shorthand it would create a widget without
/// `txt` that sets `font_size`. So a custom rule `$p:expr` is only recommended for widgets that have a property of central importance.
///
/// # Widget Type
///
/// A public associated function `widget_type` is also generated for the widget, it returns a [`WidgetType`] instance that describes the
/// widget type. Note that this is not the widget instance type, only the struct and macro type. If compiled with the `"inspector"` feature
/// the type is also available in the widget info.

/// Expands a function to a widget property.
///
/// Property functions take one [`UiNode`] child input and one or more other inputs and produces an [`UiNode`] that implements
/// the property feature.
///
/// The attribute expansion does not modify the function, it can still be used as a function directly. Some
/// properties are implemented by calling other property functions to generate a derived effect.
///
/// The attribute expansion generates a hidden trait of the same name and visibility, the trait is implemented for widget builders,
/// the widget macros use this to set the property. Because it has the same name it is imported together with the property
/// function, in practice this only matters in doc links where you must use the `fn@` disambiguator.
///
/// # Attribute
///
/// The property attribute has one required argument and three optional.
///
/// #### Nest Group
///
/// The first argument is the property [`NestGroup`]. The group defines the overall nest position
/// of the property, for example, `LAYOUT` properties always wrap `FILL` properties. This is important as widgets are open and any combination
/// of properties may end-up instantiated in the same widget.
///
/// ```
/// # fn main() { }
/// use zng::prelude_wgt::*;
///
/// #[property(LAYOUT)]
/// pub fn align(child: impl UiNode, align: impl IntoVar<Align>) -> impl UiNode {
///     // ..
/// #   child
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The nest group can be tweaked, by adding or subtracting integers, in the example bellow both properties are in the `SIZE` group,
/// but `size` is always inside `max_size`.
///
/// ```
/// # fn main() { }
/// use zng::prelude_wgt::*;
///
/// #[property(SIZE+1)]
/// pub fn size(child: impl UiNode, size: impl IntoVar<Size>) -> impl UiNode {
///     // ..
/// #   child
/// }
///
/// #[property(SIZE)]
/// pub fn max_size(child: impl UiNode, size: impl IntoVar<Size>) -> impl UiNode {
///     // ..
/// #   child
/// }
/// ```
///
/// #### Default
///
/// The next argument is an optional `default(args..)`. It defines the value to use when the property must be instantiated and no value was provided.
/// The defaults should cause the property to behave as if it is not set, as the default value will be used in widgets that only set the
/// property in `when` blocks.
///
/// ```
/// # fn main() { }
/// use zng::prelude_wgt::*;
///
/// #[property(FILL, default(rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)))]
/// pub fn background_color(child: impl UiNode, color: impl IntoVar<Rgba>) -> impl UiNode {
///     // ..
/// #   child
/// }
/// ```
///
/// In the example above the `background_color` defines a transparent color as the default, so if the background color is only set in a `when`
/// block if will only be visible when it is active.
///
/// For properties with multiple inputs the default args may be defined in a comma separated list of params, `default(dft0, ..)`.
///
/// #### Impl For
///
/// The last argument is an optional `impl(<widget-type>)`, it strongly associates
/// the property with a widget, users can set this property on the widget without needing to import the property.
///
/// Note that this makes the property have priority over all others of the same name, only a derived widget can override
/// with another strongly associated property.
///
/// Note that you can also use the [`widget_impl!`] in widget declarations to implement existing properties for a widget.
///
/// #### Capture
///
/// After the nest group and before default the `, capture, ` value indicates that the property is capture-only. This flag
/// changes how the property must be declared, the first argument is a property input and the function can have only one input,
/// no return type is allowed and the function body must be empty, unused input warnings are suppressed by the expanded code.
///
/// Capture-only properties must be captured by a widget and implemented as part of the widget's intrinsics, the reason for
/// a property function is purely to define the property signature and metadata, the capture-only property function can also
/// be used to set a property dynamically, such as in a style widget that is applied on the actual widget that captures the property.
///
/// A documentation sections explaining capture-only properties is generated for the property, it is also tagged differently in the functions list.
///
/// ```
/// # fn main() { }
/// use zng::prelude_wgt::*;
///
/// /// Children property, must be captured by panel widgets.
/// #[property(CONTEXT, capture)]
/// pub fn children(children: impl UiNodeList) { }
/// ```
///
/// # Args
///
/// The property function requires at least two args, the first is the child node and the other(s) the input values. The
/// number and type of inputs is validated at compile time, the types are limited and are identified and validated by their
/// token name, so you cannot use renamed types.
///
/// #### Child
///
/// The first function arg must be of type `impl UiNode`, it represents the child node and the property node must
/// delegate to it so that the UI tree functions correctly. The type must be an `impl` generic, a full path to [`UiNode`]
/// is allowed, but no import renames as the proc-macro attribute can only use tokens to identify the type.
///
/// #### Inputs
///
/// The second arg and optional other args define the property inputs. When a property is assigned in a widget only these inputs
/// are defined by the user, the child arg is provided by the widget builder. Property inputs are limited, and must be identifiable
/// by their token name alone. The types are validated at compile time, they must be declared using `impl` generics,
/// a full path to the generic traits is allowed, but no import renames.
///
/// #### Input Types
///
/// These are the allowed input types:
///
/// ##### `impl IntoVar<T>`
///
/// The most common type, accepts any value that can be converted [`IntoVar<T>`], usually the property defines the `T`, but it can be generic.
/// The property node must respond to var updates. The input kind is [`InputKind::Var`]. No auto-default is generated for this type, property
/// implementation should provide a default value that causes the property to behave as if it was not set.
///
/// The input can be read in `when` expressions and can be assigned in `when` blocks.
///
/// ##### `impl IntoValue<T>`
///
/// Accepts any value that can be converted [`IntoValue<T>`] that does not change, usually the property
/// defines the `T`, but it can be generic. The input kind is [`InputKind::Value`]. No auto-default is generated for this type.
///
/// The input can be read in `when` expressions, but cannot be assigned in `when` blocks.
///
/// ##### `impl UiNode`
///
/// This input accepts another [`UiNode`], the implementation must handle it like it handles the child node, delegating all methods. The
/// input kind is [`InputKind::UiNode`]. The [`NilUiNode`] is used as the default value if no other is provided.
///
/// The input cannot be read in `when` expressions, but can be assigned in `when` blocks.
///
/// ##### `impl UiNodeList`
///
/// This input accepts an [`UiNodeList`], the implementation must handle it like it handles the child node, delegating all methods. The
/// input kind is [`InputKind::UiNodeList`]. An empty list is used as the default value if no other is provided.
///
/// The input cannot be read in `when` expressions, but can be assigned in `when` blocks.
///
/// ##### `impl WidgetHandler<A>`
///
/// This input accepts any [`WidgetHandler<A>`] for the argument type `A`, usually the property defines the `A`, but it can be generic.
/// The input kind is [`InputKind::WidgetHandler`]. A no-op handler is used for the default if no other is provided.
///
/// Event handler properties usually have the `on_` name prefix. You can use the [`event_property!`] macro to generate standard event properties.
///
/// The input cannot be read in `when` expressions, but can be assigned in `when` blocks.
///
/// # Getter Properties
///
/// Most properties with var inputs are *setters*, that is the inputs affect the widget. Some properties
/// can be *getters*, detecting widget state and setting it on the *input* variable. These properties are usually named with
/// a prefix that indicates their input is actually for getting state, the prefixes `is_` and `has_` mark a property with
/// a single `bool` input that reads a widget state, the prefix `get_` and `actual_` marks a property that reads a non-boolean state from
/// the widget.
///
/// Getter properties are configured with a default read-write variable, so that they can be used in `when` expressions directly,
/// for example, `when *#is_pressed`, the `is_pressed` property has a `default(var(false))`, so it automatically initializes
/// with a read-write variable that is used in the when condition. The property attribute generates defaults automatically
/// based on the prefix, the default is `var(T::default())`, this can be overwritten just by setting the default,
/// it is not possible to declare a getter property without default.
///
/// Note that if a property is used in `when` condition without being set and without default value the when block is discarded on
/// widget build. If you are implementing a getter property that is not named using the prefixes listed above you must set `default(var(T::default())`.
///
/// # Generics
///
/// Apart from the `impl` generics of inputs and child, there is some support for named generic types, only one named generic is allowed
/// for inputs `impl IntoVar<T>`, `impl IntoValue<T>` and `impl WidgetHandler<A>`.
///
/// # Output
///
/// The property output type must be any type that implements [`UiNode`], usually an opaque type `impl UiNode` is used. The property
/// node can be anything, as long as it delegates to the child node, see [`match_node`] or [`ui_node`] about implementing a node.
///
/// Some common property patterns have helper functions, for example, to setup a context var you can use the [`with_context_var`] function.
///

/// Expands an impl block into an [`UiNode`] trait implementation.
///
/// Missing [`UiNode`] methods are generated by this macro. The generation is configured in the macro arguments.
/// The arguments can be a single keyword, a delegate or an entire struct declaration.
///
/// The general idea is you implement only the methods required by your node and configure this macro to generate the methods
/// that are just boilerplate UI tree propagation, and in [new node](#new-node) mode var and event handlers can be inited automatically
/// as well.
///
/// # Delegate to single `impl UiNode`
///
/// If your node contains a single child node, you can configure the attribute
/// to delegate the method calls for the child node.
///
/// ```
/// # fn main() { }
/// use zng::prelude_wgt::*;
///
/// struct MyNode<C> {
///     child: C
/// }
/// #[ui_node(delegate = &mut self.child)]
/// impl<C: UiNode> UiNode for MyNode<C> { }
/// ```
///
/// If the child node is in a field named `child` you can use this shorthand to the same effect:
///
/// ```
/// # fn main() { }
/// # use zng::prelude_wgt::*;
/// # struct MyNode<C> { child: C }
/// #[ui_node(child)]
/// impl<C: UiNode> UiNode for MyNode<C> { }
/// ```
///
/// The generated code simply calls the same [`UiNode`] method in the child.
///
/// # Delegate to a `impl UiNodeList`
///
/// If your node contains multiple children nodes in a type that implements [`UiNodeList`],
/// you can configure the attribute to delegate to the equivalent list methods.
///
/// ```
/// # fn main() { }
/// use zng::prelude_wgt::*;
///
/// struct MyNode<L> {
///     children: L
/// }
/// #[ui_node(delegate_list = &mut self.children)]
/// impl<L: UiNodeList> UiNode for MyNode<L> { }
/// ```
///
/// If the children list is a member named `children` you can use this shorthand to the same effect:
///
/// ```
/// # fn main() { }
/// # use zng::prelude_wgt::*;
/// # struct MyNode<L> { children: L }
/// #[ui_node(children)]
/// impl<L: UiNodeList> UiNode for MyNode<L> { }
/// ```
///
/// The generated code simply calls the equivalent [`UiNodeList`] method in the list.
/// That is the same method name with the `_all` prefix. So `UiNode::init` maps to `UiNodeList::init_all` and so on.
///
/// ## Don't Delegate
///
/// If your node does not have any child nodes you can configure the attribute to generate empty missing methods.
///
/// ```
/// # fn main() { }
/// # use zng::prelude_wgt::*;
/// # struct MyNode { }
/// #[ui_node(none)]
/// impl UiNode for MyNode { }
/// ```
///
/// The generated [`measure`] and [`layout`] code returns the fill size.
///
/// The other generated methods are empty.
///
/// # Validation
///
/// If delegation is configured but no delegation occurs in the manually implemented methods
/// you get the error ``"auto impl delegates call to `{}` but this manual impl does not"``.
///
/// To disable this error use `#[allow_(zng::missing_delegate)]` in the method or in the `impl` block. The
/// error is also not shown if the method body contains a call to the [`todo!()`] macro.
///
/// The [`measure`] method is an exception to this and will not show the error, its ideal implementation
/// is one where the entire sub-tree is skipped from the computation.
///
/// # Mixing Methods
///
/// You can use the same `impl` block to define [`UiNode`] methods and
/// associated methods by using this attribute in a `impl` block without trait. The [`UiNode`]
/// methods must be tagged with the `#[UiNode]` pseudo-attribute.
///
/// ```
/// # fn main() { }
/// # use zng::prelude_wgt::*;
/// # struct MyNode { child: BoxedUiNode }
/// #[ui_node(child)]
/// impl MyNode {
///     fn do_the_thing(&mut self) {
///         // ..
///     }
///
///     #[UiNode]
///     fn init(&mut self) {
///         self.child.init();
///         self.do_the_thing();
///     }
///
///     #[UiNode]
///     fn update(&mut self, updates: &WidgetUpdates) {
///         self.child.update(updates);
///         self.do_the_thing();
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The above code expands to two `impl` blocks, one with the associated method and the other with
/// the [`UiNode`] implementation.
///
/// This is particularly useful for nodes that have a large amount of generic constraints, you just type them once.
///
/// # New Node
///
/// In all the usage seen so far you must declare the `struct` type and the generic bounds to
/// make it work in the `impl` block, and any var or event in it needs to be subscribed manually. You can
/// avoid this extra boilerplate by declaring the node `struct` as an arg for the macro.
///
/// ```
/// # fn main() { }
/// # use zng::prelude_wgt::*;
/// fn my_widget_node(child: impl UiNode, number: impl IntoVar<u32>) -> impl UiNode {
///     #[ui_node(struct MyNode {
///         child: impl UiNode,
///         #[var] number: Var<u32>,
///     })]
///     impl UiNode for MyNode {
///         fn update(&mut self, updates: &WidgetUpdates) {
///             self.child.update(updates);
///             if let Some(n) = self.number.get_new() {
///                 println!("new number: {n}");
///             }
///         }
///     }
///     MyNode {
///         child,
///         number: number.into_var(),
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// In the example above the `MyNode` struct is declared with two generic params: `T_child` and `T_var`, the unimplemented
/// node methods are delegated to `child` because of the name, and the `number` var is subscribed automatically because of
/// the `#[var]` pseudo attribute.
///
/// Note that you can also use [`node::match_node`] to declare *anonymous* nodes, most of the properties are implemented using
/// this node instead of the `#[ui_node]` macro.
///
/// #### Generics
///
/// You can declare named generics in the `struct`, those are copied to the implement block, you can also have members with type
/// `impl Trait`, a named generic is generated for these, the generated name is `T_member`. You can use named generics in the `impl`
/// generics the same way as you would in a function.
///
/// #### Impl Block
///
/// The impl block cannot have any generics, they are added automatically, the `UiNode for` part is optional, like in the delegating
/// mode, if you omit the trait you must annotate each node method with the `#[UiNode]` pseudo attribute.
///
/// #### Delegation
///
/// Delegation is limited to members named `child` or `children`, there is no way to declare a custom delegation in *new node*
/// mode. If no specially named member is present the `none` delegation is used.
///
/// #### Subscription
///
/// You can mark members with the `#[var]` or `#[event]` pseudo attributes to generate initialization code that subscribes the var or
/// event to the [`WIDGET`] context. The init code is placed in a method with signature `fn auto_subs(&mut self)`,
/// if you manually implement the `init` node method you must call `self.auto_subs();` in it, a compile time error is emitted if the call is missing.
///
/// #### Limitations
///
/// The new node type must be private, you cannot set visibility modifiers. The struct cannot have any attribute set on it, but you can
/// have attributes in members, the `#[cfg]` attribute is copied to generated generics. The `impl Trait` auto-generics only works for
/// the entire type of a generic, you cannot declare a type `Vec<impl Debug>` for example.
