//! App extensions, context, events and commands API.
//!
//! # Runtime
//!
//! A typical app instance has two processes, the initial process called the *app-process*, and a second process called the
//! *view-process*. The app-process implements the event loop and updates, the view-process implements the platform integration and
//! renderer, the app-process controls the view-process, most of the time app implementers don't interact directly with it, except
//! at the start where the view-process is spawned.
//!
//! The reason for this dual process architecture is mostly for resilience, the unsafe interactions with the operating system and
//! graphics driver are isolated in a different process, in case of crashes the view-process is respawned automatically and
//! all windows are recreated. It is possible to run the app in a single process, in this case the view runs in the main thread
//! and the app main loop in another.
//!
//! ## View-Process
//!
//! To simplify distribution the view-process is an instance of the same app executable, the view-process crate injects
//! their own "main" in the [`zng::env::init!`] call, automatically taking over the process if the executable spawns as a view-process.
//!
//! On the first instance of the app executable the `init` only inits the env and returns, the app init spawns a second process
//! marked as the view-process, on this second instance the init call never returns, for this reason the init
//! must be called early in main, all code before the `init` call runs in both the app and view processes.
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! zng = { version = "0.11.2", features = ["view_prebuilt"] }
//! ```
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use zng::prelude::*;
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     app_and_view();
//!     zng::env::init!(); // init only returns if it is not called in the view-process.
//!     app();
//! }
//!
//! fn app_and_view() {
//!     // code here runs in the app-process and view-process.
//! }
//!
//! fn app() {
//!     // code here only runs in the app-process.
//!
//!     APP.defaults().run(async {
//!         // ..
//!     })
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Same Process
//!
//! You can also run the view in the same process, this mode of execution is slightly more efficient, but
//! your app will not be resilient to crashes caused by the operating system or graphics driver, the app code
//! will also run in a different thread, not the main.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use zng::prelude::*;
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     zng::env::init!();
//!     zng::view_process::prebuilt::run_same_process(app);
//! }
//!
//! fn app() {
//!     // code here runs in a different thread, the main thread becomes the view.
//!     APP.defaults().run(async {
//!         // ..
//!     })
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Note that you must still call `init!` as it also initializes the app metadata and directories.
//!
//! # Headless
//!
//! The app can also run *headless*, where no window is actually created, optionally with real rendering.
//! This mode is useful for running integration tests, or for rendering images.
//!
//! ```
//! use zng::prelude::*;
//!
//! let mut app = APP.defaults().run_headless(/* with_renderer: */ false);
//! app.run_window(async {
//!     Window! {
//!         child = Text!("Some text");
//!         auto_size = true;
//!
//!         render_mode = window::RenderMode::Software;
//!         frame_capture_mode = window::FrameCaptureMode::Next;
//!
//!         on_frame_image_ready = async_hn!(|args: window::FrameImageReadyArgs| {
//!             if let Some(img) = args.frame_image {
//!                 // if the app runs with `run_headless(/* with_renderer: */ true)` an image is captured
//!                 // and saved here.
//!                 img.save("screenshot.png").await.unwrap();
//!             }
//!
//!             // close the window, causing the app to exit.
//!             WINDOW.close();
//!         });
//!     }
//! });
//! ```
//!
//! You can also run multiple headless apps in the same process, one per thread, if the crate is build using the `"multi_app"` feature.
//!
//! # App Extension
//!
//! Apps can be extended to provide new services and events, in fact all default services and events are implemented as extensions
//! loaded by [`APP.defaults()`]. The app extension API is [`AppExtension`]. Usually extensions are named with suffix `Manager`, but
//! that is not a requirement.
//!
//! ```
//! use zng::{app::{AppExtended, AppExtension}, APP};
//!
//! #[derive(Default)]
//! pub struct HelloManager {}
//! impl AppExtension for HelloManager {
//!     fn init(&mut self) {
//!         println!("Hello init!");
//!     }
//!
//!     fn update_preview(&mut self) {
//!         println!("Hello before UI!");
//!     }
//!
//!     fn update(&mut self) {
//!         println!("Hello after UI!");
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! pub fn app() -> AppExtended<impl AppExtension> {
//!     APP.defaults().extend(HelloManager::default())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Services
//!
//! App services are defined by convention, there is no service trait or struct. Proper service implementations follow
//! these rules:
//!
//! #### App services are an unit struct named like a static
//!
//! This is because services are a kind of *singleton*. The service API is implemented as methods on the service struct.
//!
//! ```
//! # use zng::var::*;
//! #[allow(non_camel_case_types)]
//! pub struct SCREAMING_CASE;
//! impl SCREAMING_CASE {
//!     pub fn state(&self) -> impl Var<bool> {
//! #       var(true)
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Note that you need to suppress a lint if the service name has more then one word.
//!
//! Service state and config methods should prefer variables over direct values. The use of variables allows the service state
//! to be plugged directly into the UI. Async operations should prefer using [`ResponseVar<R>`] over `async` methods for
//! the same reason.
//!
//! #### App services lifetime is the current app lifetime
//!
//! Unlike a simple singleton app services must only live for the duration of the app and must support
//! multiple parallel instances if built with the `"multi_app"` feature. You can use private
//! [`app_local!`] static variables as backing storage to fulfill this requirement.
//!
//! A common pattern in the zng services is to name the app locals with a `_SV` suffix.
//!
//! Services do not expose the app local locking, all state output is cloned the state is only locked
//! for the duration of the service method call.
//!
//! #### App services don't change public state mid update
//!
//! All widgets using the service during the same update see the same state. State change requests are scheduled
//! for the next update, just like variable updates or event notifications. Services also request
//! an [`UPDATES.update`] after scheduling to wake-up the app in case the service request was made from a [`task`] thread.
//!
//! This is even true for the [`INSTANT`] service, although this can be configured for this service using [`APP.pause_time_for_update`].
//!
//! [`APP.pause_time_for_update`]: zng_app::APP::pause_time_for_update
//!
//! ### Examples
//!
//! Fulfilling service requests is where the [`AppExtension`] comes in, it is possible to declare a simple standalone
//! service using only variables, `Event::on_event` and `UPDATES.run_hn_once`, but an app extension is more efficient
//! and more easy to implement.
//!
//! If the service request can fail or be delayed it is common for the request method to return a [`ResponseVar<R>`]
//! that is updated once the request is finished. You can also make the method `async`, but a response var is superior
//! because it can be plugged directly into any UI property, and it can still be awaited using the variable async methods.
//!
//! If the service request cannot fail and it is guaranteed to affect an observable change in the service state in the
//! next update a response var is not needed.
//!
//! The example below demonstrates an app extension implementation that provides a service.
//!
//! ```
//! use zng::{prelude_wgt::*, app::AppExtension};
//!
//! /// Foo service.
//! pub struct FOO;
//!
//! impl FOO {
//!     /// Foo read-write var.
//!     pub fn config(&self) -> impl Var<bool> {
//!         FOO_SV.read().config.clone()
//!     }
//!
//!     /// Foo request.
//!     pub fn request(&self, request: char) -> ResponseVar<char> {
//!         UPDATES.update(None);
//!
//!         let mut foo = FOO_SV.write();
//!         let (responder, response) = response_var();
//!         foo.requests.push((request, responder));
//!         response
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! struct FooService {
//!     config: ArcVar<bool>,
//!     requests: Vec<(char, ResponderVar<char>)>,
//! }
//!
//! app_local! {
//!     static FOO_SV: FooService = FooService { config: var(false), requests: vec![] };
//! }
//!
//! /// Foo app extension.
//! ///
//! /// # Services
//! ///
//! /// Services provided by this extension.
//! ///
//! /// * [`FOO`]
//! #[derive(Default)]
//! pub struct FooManager { }
//!
//! impl AppExtension for FooManager {
//!     fn update(&mut self) {
//!         let mut foo = FOO_SV.write();
//!
//!         if let Some(cfg) = foo.config.get_new() {
//!             println!("foo cfg={cfg}");
//!         }
//!
//!         for (request, responder) in foo.requests.drain(..) {
//!             println!("foo request {request:?}");
//!             responder.respond(request);
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Note that in the example requests are processed in the [`AppExtension::update`] update that is called
//! after all widgets have had a chance to make requests. Requests can also be made from parallel [`task`] threads so
//! the service also requests an [`UPDATES.update`] just in case there is no update running. If you expect to receive many
//! requests from parallel tasks you can also process requests in the [`AppExtension::update`] instead, but there is probably
//! little practical difference.
//!
//! # Init & Main Loop
//!
//! A headed app initializes in this sequence:
//!
//! 1. [`AppExtension::register`] is called.
//! 2. [`AppExtension::enable_device_events`] is queried.
//! 3. Spawn view-process.
//! 4. [`AppExtension::init`] is called.
//! 5. Schedule the app run future to run in the first preview update.
//! 6. Does [updates loop](#updates-loop).
//! 7. Does [update events loop](#update-events-loop).
//! 6. Does [main loop](#main-loop).
//!
//! #### Main Loop
//!
//! The main loop coordinates view-process events, timers, app events and updates. There is no scheduler, update and event requests
//! are captured and coalesced to various buffers that are drained in known sequential order. App extensions update one at a time
//! in the order they are registered. Windows and widgets update in parallel by default, this is controlled by [`WINDOWS.parallel`] and [`parallel`].
//!
//! 1. Sleep if there are not pending events or updates.
//!    * If the view-process is busy blocks until it sends a message, this is a mechanism to stop the app-process
//!       from overwhelming the view-process.
//!    * Block until a message is received, from the view-process or from other app threads.
//!    * If there are [`TIMERS`] or [`VARS`] animations the message block has a deadline to the nearest timer or animation frame.
//!        * Animations have a fixed frame-rate defined in [`VARS.frame_duration`], it is 60 frames-per-second by default.
//! 2. Calls elapsed timer handlers.
//! 3. Calls elapsed animation handlers.
//!     * These handlers mostly just request var updates are applied in the updates loop.
//! 4. Does a [view events loop](#view-events-loop).
//! 4. Does an [updates loop](#updates-loop).
//! 5. Does an [update events loop](#update-events-loop).
//! 6. If the view-process is not busy does a [layout loop and render](#layout-loop-and-render).
//! 7. If exit was requested and not cancelled breaks the loop.
//!     * Exit is requested automatically when the last open window closes, this is controlled by [`WINDOWS.exit_on_last_close`].
//!     * Exit can also be requested using [`APP.exit`].
//!
//! #### View Events Loop
//!
//! All pending events send by the view-process are coalesced and notify sequentially.
//!
//! 1. For each event in the received order (FIFO) that converts to a RAW event.
//!     1. Calls [`AppExtension::event_preview`].
//!     2. Calls [`Event::on_pre_event`] handlers.
//!     3. Calls [`AppExtension::event_ui`].
//!         * Raw events don't target any widget, but widgets can subscribe, subscribers receive the event in parallel by default.
//!     4. Calls [`AppExtension::event`].
//!     5. Calls [`Event::on_event`] handlers.
//!     6. Does an [updates loop](#updates-loop).
//! 2. Frame rendered raw event.
//!     * Same notification sequence as other view-events, just delayed.
//!
//! #### Updates Loop
//!
//! The updates loop rebuilds info trees if needed , applies pending variable updates and hooks and collects event updates
//! requested by the app.
//!
//! 1. Takes info rebuild request flag.
//!     * Calls [`AppExtension::info`] if needed.
//!     * Windows and widgets that requested info (re)build are called.
//!     * Info rebuild happens in parallel by default.
//! 2. Takes events and updates requests.
//!     1. Event hooks are called for new event requests.
//!         * Full event notification is delayed to after the updates loop.
//!     2. [var updates loop](#var-updates-loop)
//!     3. Calls [`AppExtension::update_preview`] if any update was requested.
//!     4. Calls [`UPDATES.on_pre_update`] handlers if needed.
//!     5. Calls [`AppExtension::update_ui`] if any update was requested.
//!         * Windows and widgets that requested update receive it here.
//!         * All the pending updates are processed in one pass, all targeted widgets are visited once, in parallel by default.
//!     6. Calls [`AppExtension::update`] if any update was requested.
//!     7. Calls [`UPDATES.on_update`] handlers if needed.
//! 3. The loop repeats immediately if any info rebuild or update was requested by update callbacks.
//!     * The loops breaks if it repeats over 1000 times.
//!     * An error is logged with a trace the most frequent sources of update requests.
//!
//! #### Var Updates Loop
//!
//! The variable updates loop applies pending modifications, calls hooks to update variable and bindings.
//!
//! 1. Pending variable modifications are applied.
//! 2. Var hooks are called.
//!     * The mapping and binding mechanism is implemented using hooks.
//! 3. The loop repeats until hooks have stopped modifying variables.
//!     * The loop breaks if it repeats over 1000 times.
//!     * An error is logged if this happens.
//!
//! #### Update Events Loop
//!
//! The update events loop notifies each event raised by the app code during previous updates.
//!
//! 1. For each event in the request order (FIFO).
//!     1. Calls [`AppExtension::event_preview`].
//!     2. Calls [`Event::on_pre_event`] handlers.
//!     3. Calls [`AppExtension::event_ui`].
//!         * Windows and widgets targeted by the event update receive it here.
//!         * If the event targets multiple widgets they receive it in parallel by default.
//!     4. Calls [`AppExtension::event`].
//!     5. Calls [`Event::on_event`] handlers.
//!     6. Does an [updates loop](#updates-loop).
//!
//! #### Layout Loop and Render
//!
//! Layout and render requests are coalesced, multiple layout requests for the same widget update it once, multiple
//! render requests become one frame, and if both render and render_update are requested for a window it will fully render.
//!
//! 1. Take layout and render requests.
//! 2. Layout loop.
//!     1. Calls [`AppExtension::layout`].
//!         * Windows and widgets that requested layout update in parallel by default.
//!     2. Does an [updates loop](#updates-loop).
//!     3. Take layout and render requests, the loop repeats immediately if layout was requested again.
//!         * The loop breaks if it repeats over 1000 times.
//!         * An error is logged with a trace the most frequent sources of update requests.
//! 3. If render was requested, calls [`AppExtension::render`].
//!     * Windows and widgets that requested render (or render_update) do know in parallel by default.
//!     * The render pass updates widget transforms and hit-test, generates a display list and sends it to the view-process.

/// On VS Code with the CodeLLDB extension you can add this workspace configuration:
