debug_default = ["zng-var/debug_default", "zng-app-context/dyn_closure"]

# Use dynamic dispatch at the node level by placing each property node in a `BoxedUiNode` and enabling `UiNode::cfg_boxed`.
#
# This speeds-up compilation time at the cost of runtime.

# Allows multiple app instances per-process.
#
# This feature allows multiple apps, one app per thread at a time. The `LocalContext` tracks
# what app is currently running in each thread and `app_local!` statics switch to the value of each app
# depending on the current thread.
#
# Not enabled by default, but enabled by `feature="test_util"`.

# Instrument every widget outer-most node to trace UI methods.

# Instrument every property and intrinsic node to trace UI methods.
#
# Note that this can cause very large trace files and bad performance.

# Only enables in `not(any(target_arch = "wasm32", target_os = "android", target_os = "ios"))` builds.
