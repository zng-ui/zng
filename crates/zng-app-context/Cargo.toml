# Allows multiple app instances per-process.
#
# This feature allows multiple apps, one app per thread at a time. The `LocalContext` tracks
# what app is currently running in each thread and `app_local!` statics switch to the value of each app
# depending on the current thread.

# Enable `"multi_app"` in debug builds.

# Box closures at opportune places, such as `Var::map`, reducing the number of monomorphised types.
#
# This speeds-up compilation time at the cost of runtime.
