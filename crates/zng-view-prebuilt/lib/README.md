# Local Prebuilt

Run `do prebuild` to pre-build the current `zng-view` and output the binary library to this directory.

If the library file for the OS is not found here the latest release from GitHub will be used. It will only
work if there are no unreleased breaking changes in the current `zng-view-api`.
